Hi, I'm Brian! I'm a full-time open source software developer.

I've been programming for fun since I was a kid, in the late 80's - early 90's. Later, I went to college for Computer Science, where I learned more about programming and was exposed to more areas of Computer Science. I didn't realize how much I enjoyed programming until I was able to create "real-world" applications and see other people use what I've created. Through open source software development, I've been able to increase my own excitement for programming, as well as, help others achieve their own goals by providing the tools and libraries they use everyday.
